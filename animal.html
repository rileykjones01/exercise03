      This elephant is standing with its trunk in the air. Elephants live in both Africa and Asia,
      but this looks like an African savanna elephant because its tusks curve outward and its ears are large.
      Asian elephants have smaller ears and not all of them have tusks. African forest elephants have smaller, oval-shaped
      ears and their tusks point downwards, which distinguishes them from their savanna cousins. African forest elephants
      are also much more elusive, and their population numbers are generally measured by counting their dung,
      rather than counting the elephants themselves.
